# StupidMayaTools

Collection of tools that(I find) are handy in maya.

Tools:
Clone(&detach) face selection within the polyshape
Extract(&detach) face selection to a new polyshape
Center to world 0,0,0
Count object selection(kinda useless, more for testing)
Open this script in atom(most likely specific to my install)
Rename(kinda useless, more for testing)
Shell  the object from extrude function. Similar to zbrush's panelloop
Inset(also based on extrude) just to save some time.
render stuff sets cameras based on name

hair converts poly meshes output by xgen interactive groom to splines
